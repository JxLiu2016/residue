# Overview
Residue is an effort to standardize application logging and making logging as a *microservice* by implementing simple logging API, easily configurable, build-in log rotators, simple way to format your log messages according to need of your application and most of all language-independent.

It is fully configurable and supports high-level security, compression and asyncronous operations. It uses [Easylogging++](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp) under the hood, that itself is a feature-rich library.

# Features
Some of the notable features are listed below

 * Lightweight: Residue is very light on CPU and RAM. On start-up it will only take approx 2mb of RAM and while running it will keep the memory as clean as possible using as low CPU as possible.
 * Asyncronous: Residue has been built with speed in mind right from the beginning. It runs on 10 threads on idle and an extra thread for log rotation task.
 * *Context switching* is a concept designed as part of asyncronous processing where a *request queue* is different from *processing queue*. Once *processing queue* is emptied (i.e, all the requests are processed from the queue) the *request queue* and *processed queue* is swapped. This swapping is what we call *context switching*.
 * *Log rotation* has been built in to the server that runs on a separate thread, allowing you to create backups and compress them. Every logger can be set up to have it's own rotation frequency from `hourly` to `yearly` depending on your application.
 * *Bulk requests* is another concept that makes logging requests process much faster and highly compressible making them low on network.
 * Security: Residue uses [mine](https://github.com/muflihun/mine) and [Ripe](https://github.com/muflihun/ripe) for securing the data. It consists of several layers and techniques to secure the requests and to prevent unauthorised application from logging.
 * Compression: Residue server and official client libraries provide ability to compress the network packets which makes a big difference in amount of data transferred over the wire.
 * Speed is not compromised in any way and there is a lot of testing being done every day to ensure that logging server meets the speed requirements.
 * There are many more features available for this new application. Please feel free to download a copy of residue binary and run it.

# Compatibility And Integration
No matter what language is your application written in, residue is compatible and can be used as central logging server. All you need is client library. You can either write your own using [CLIENT_DEVELOPMENT.md](/docs/CLIENT_DEVELOPMENT.md) guidelines or use existing one.

C++: If your application is written in C++ you can use [CLIENT_API.md](/docs/CLIENT_API.md) to start integrating. If you're already using Easylogging++ or similar logging library (that supports `LOG` helper macros) in your application, integration can be done in no more than 2 minutes.

Java: A very massive commercial application that has multiple dependencies and modules and it was using Log4J logging library took us no more than half hour to fully replace existing library with [residue java client library](https://github.com/muflihun/residue-java).

We're also actively working on client libraries for residue in other languages. Please feel free to contribute.

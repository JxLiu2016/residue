# Demo Server
Residue server is hosted on http://residue-demo.muflihun.com to demonstrate how it all works.

This machine has two servers running.

## Non-Restrictive Server
This server can be connected via port 8777. 

This is open and non-restrictive server which means, it can:
 
 * Accept plain connections
 * Accept plain log requests
 * Allow unknown clients and loggers
 
You can stream these logs on your browser via http://residue-demo.muflihun.com:8775/?clientId=muflihun00102030

## Closed Server
This server can be connected via port 8772.

 * You will need [server public key](/tools/closed-server/server.pub) to access this server
 * Unknown clients are not allowed and there is only one client registered (client_id: [`client-1`](/tools/closed-server/client-1.pem), default logger ID: `default`)
 * Unknown loggers are allowed

You can stream these logs on your browser via http://residue-demo.muflihun.com:8770/?clientId=client-1

## Node.js Sample Client
The most simple demo client can help you understand on how it all works.

 * Download [Node.js sample app](https://github.com/muflihun/residue-node/tree/master/samples/node) code
 * Install the package using `npm install`
 * Start the app using `node app.js`
 * [Stream the logs](http://residue-demo.muflihun.com:8775/?clientId=muflihun00102030)
 * Now open http://localhost:3009 and check the residue logs streaming tab on your browser
 
If you wish to try closed server you following following additional steps:

 * Download [server public key](/tools/closed-server/server.pub) to sample app directory
 * Replain `client.conf.json` to:
  ```
  {
    "url": "residue-demo.muflihun.com:8772",
    "application_id": "com.muflihun.residue.sampleapp",
    "rsa_key_size": 2048,
    "utc_time": false,
    "time_offset": 0,
    "dispatch_delay": 1,
    "main_thread_id": "Main Thread",
    "server_public_key": "server.pub",
    "client_id": "client-1",
    "client_private_key": "keys/muflihun00102030.pem"
}
  ```
 * Start the app using `node app.js`
 * [Stream the logs](http://residue-demo.muflihun.com:8770/?clientId=client-1)
 * Now open http://localhost:3009 and check the residue logs streaming tab on your browser
 
## Summary
The streaming UI uses [`resitail`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resitail) which is under development but has enough functionality to show you how residue works and what it does. Currently, it does not support HTTPS, filtering or searching but it's irrelevant to the residue server.

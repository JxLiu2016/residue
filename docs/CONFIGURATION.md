# Configuration

This document gives you details on configuring residue

Residue is fully configurable to support various features and for security. Configuration is always in [JSON](http://json.org/) format.

You can use [Server Config Tool](https://muflihun.github.io/residue/create-server-config) to create configurations for your server

### `admin_port`
[Integer] Port that admin server listens to. All the admin requests are sent to this port. These requests must be encrypted using [`server_key`](#server_key).

Default: `8776`

### `connect_port`
[Integer] Port that connection server listens to. All the connection requests are sent to this port and handled accordingly. This is the port that all the clients libraries initially connect to.

Default: `8777`

### `token_port`
[Integer] Port that token server listens to. If loggers require a token to use it, this is where client will obtain the token.

Default: `8778`

### `logging_port`
[Integer] Port that logging server listens to. This is where all the log requests are sent.

Default: `8779`

### `default_key_size`
[Integer] Default symmetric key size (`128`, `192` or `256`) for clients that do not specify key size. See [`key_size`](#known_clientskey_size)

Default: `256`

### `server_key`
[String] A 256-bit server key that is used for admin services. See [`admin_port`](#admin_port)

Default: Randomly generated and residue outputs it in start-up

### `server_rsa_private_key`
[Optional, String] RSA private key (PEM format file path). You can use `$RESIDUE_HOME` environment variable in this file path. If provided, it is used to read initial requests for extra security.

Note: You should have big enough key to cover for unknown clients. Remember, unknown clients will need to send their public key in initial request, which makes request quite bigger.

You can use following ripe command to generate the key (this will generate 8192-bit key which can encrypt 1013 bytes to data)

```
ripe -g --rsa --length 8192 --out-public server-public.pem --out-private server-private.pem
```

Alternatively, you can use openssl command-line tool.

See [Ripe](https://github.com/muflihun/ripe#readme) for more details.

### `server_rsa_public_key`
[String] Corresponding public key for [`server_rsa_private_key`](#server_rsa_private_key). You can use `$RESIDUE_HOME` environment variable in this file path.

### `server_rsa_secret`
[String] If private key is encrypted, this is the secret (passphrase) to decrypt it. **THIS SHOULD BE HEX ENCODED**.

### `enable_cli`
[Boolean] Whether CLI is enabled on server or not. See [CLI_COMMANDS.md](/docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md) for possible input commands.

Default: `true`

### `allow_insecure_connection`
[Boolean] Specifies whether plain connections to the server are allowed or not. Either this should be true or server key pair must be provided (or both)

Default: `true`

### `allow_default_access_code`
[Boolean] Specifies whether all the loggers with no access codes are automatically allowed or not. If allowed, Easylogging++ default configurations are used.

Default: `true`

### `allow_unknown_loggers`
[Boolean] Specifies whether loggers other than the ones in [`known_loggers`](#known_loggers) list are allowed or ignored / rejected.

Default: `true`

### `allow_unknown_clients`
[Boolean] Specifies whether clients other than the ones in [`known_clients`](#known_clients) list are allowed or ignored / rejected.

Default: `true`

### `requires_token`
[Boolean] Turn on/off token checking with each log request.

Default: `true`

### `immediate_flush`
[Boolean] Specifies whether to flush logger immediately after writing to it or not. Performance of the server is not affected with turning it on as we use separate thread for logging.

Default: `true`

### `requires_timestamp`
[Boolean] Specifies whether timestamp is absolutely required or not. Timestamp is `_t` value for each incoming requests.

This does not affect admin requests, timestamps for admin requests is always required.

See [`timestamp_validity`](#timestamp_validity)

Default: `false`

### `compression`
[Boolean] Specifies whether compression is enabled or not.

You should note few points:

 * If this is enabled client libraries should take advantage of it and send compressed data. However, if it doesn't, request is still processed.
 * Only log requests should be compressed, other requests (connection, token, touch etc) are sent normally.
 * Outgoing data (from server) is never compressed.

Compression has great affect and can save big data. We recommend you to enable compression in your server. Just to give you little bit of idea, when we run [simple example project](https://github.com/muflihun/residue-cpp/tree/master/samples/detailed-cmake) to log 1246 requests, without compression data transferred was `488669 bytes` and with compression it was `44509 bytes`. Same data transferred has same performance with high reliability.

It always has very good performance when you have [`compression`](#compression) and [`allow_bulk_log_request`](#allow_bulk_log_request) both active. In one of our big test we had following result:

 * With compression and bulk (size: 20): `24100423 bytes`
 * Without compression and bulk (size: 20): `327100683 bytes` (more than 92.6% of less-data transferred)
 * Without compression and non-bulk request: `398001463 bytes`

This is because lossless-compression is done on similar bytes. If you wish to know more about compression algorithm see [gzlib algorithm](www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt).

Default: `true`

### `allow_bulk_log_request`
[Boolean] Specifies whether clients can send bulk log requests or not.

See [`max_items_in_bulk`](#max_items_in_bulk) and [`compression`](#compression)

Default: `true`

### `max_items_in_bulk`
[Integer] Maximum number of bulk items allowed.

If client sends more requests than this all the extra requests are ignored by server (with verbose warning). User is not informed about this as we handle log requests asynchronously.

Default: `5`

### `timestamp_validity`
[Integer] Integer value in seconds that specifies validity of timestamp `_t` in request

Minimum: `30`

Default: `120`

### `client_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines the age of a client. After this age, client is considered _dead_. Clients library can `TOUCH` request just before (subject to `TOUCH_THRESHOLD` value in the library) dying to bring it back to life provided it's not already dead. After client is dead, it needs to reconnect and obtain a new key.

Default: `259200` (3 days)

Minimum: `120`

Forever: `0` (not recommended)

### `non_acknowledged_client_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines the age of a client that is not yet acknowledged by client library.

Note: You cannot `TOUCH` a non-acknowledged client.

Minimum: `120`

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

Cannot set it to *forever*

### `max_token_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines maximum age of the token

Minimum: `15`

Default: `0` (Forever)

### `token_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines default age of the token.

This age is used in following scenarios:

 * If [`allow_default_access_code`](#allow_default_access_code) is `true` and token with unknown access code is requested, this is the age of the token.
 * If no access code is specified with access code, this is the age of that token.

Minimum: `15`

Maximum: [`max_token_age`](#max_token_age)

Default: `3600` or `max_token_age` (which ever is smaller)

Forever: `0` (not recommended)

### `client_integrity_task_interval`
[Integer] Value that should be >= `client_age` or `non_acknowledged_client_age` (whichever is lower).

This is a task that ensures integrity of the clients to remove dead clients that are unusable (and tokens accordingly)

Default: `300` or `min(client_age, non_acknowledged_client_age)` [whichever is higher]

Minimum: `300`

### `dispatch_delay`
[Integer] Value that defines the delay (in milliseconds) between two log message dispatch.

**Note** Increasing this value is going to slow down your server (for obvious reasons, i.e, it's a delay).

Default: `1` (recommended)

Maximum: `500`

Turn off delay: `0` (not recommended)

### `archived_log_directory`

$list = array(
    "known_loggers" => array(
        array(
            "logger_id" => "another",
            "configuration_file" => "samples/configurations/blah.conf"
        ),
    ),
);

echo json_encode($list);
```

Call this file `localConfig.php` and run it as server `php -S localhost:8000`

Endpoint URL is `http://localhost:8000/localConfig.php`

You need to make sure that [`configuration_file`](#configuration_file) exists on the server.

### `known_loggers`
[Array] Object of loggers that are known to the server. You can use this to provide extra security and setup [`access_codes`](#access_codes) for each logger (to obtain the token and their respective lifetime)

#### `known_loggers`::`logger_id`
[String] The logger ID

#### `known_loggers`::`configuration_file`
[String] Path to [Easylogging++ configuration file](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp#using-configuration-file). You can use `$RESIDUE_HOME` environment variable in this file path. When the new logger is registered, it's configured using this configuration.

Residue supports following [custom format specifiers](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp#custom-format-specifiers):

| Format Specifier | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `%client_id`     | Print client ID with specified log format / level |
| `%ip`     | IP address of the request |

| 3 | `vWARNING` |
| 2 | `vNOTICE` |
| 1 | `vINFO` |

##### Configuration Errors
***

You're not allowed to use following configurations in your configuration file as residue handles these configurations differently and ignore your configurations. Residue will not start until these configuration lines are removed. This is so that user does not expect anything from these configuration items.

 * `Max_Log_File_Size`
 * `To_Standard_Output`
 * `Log_Flush_Threshold`

#### `known_loggers`::`access_codes`
[Array] Object that is defined as `{"code" : "<string of any length>", "token_age" : <integer>}`.

Default: [`token_age`](#token_age)

Maximum: [`max_token_age`](#max_token_age)

#### `known_loggers`::`access_code_blacklist`
[Array] String that define black listed access codes. You may access code to this list if one of the access codes is compromised. (alternatively, you may remove from the original list)

#### `known_loggers`::`rotation_freq`
[String] One of [`never`, `hourly`, `six_hours`, `twelve_hours`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`] to specify rotation frequency for corresponding log files. This is rotated regardless of file size.

Log rotation rounds off to the nearest denominator. To get better understanding of this round off, consider following table.

|   Frequency        |       Next Schedule                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| `yearly`           | Last day of the each year at `23:59:59`                  |

Default: `never`

#### `known_loggers`::`user`
[String] Linux / mac user assigned to known logger. All the log files associated to the corresponding logger will belong to this user with `RW-R-----` permissions

Default: Current process user

#### `known_loggers`::`archived_log_filename`

Make sure environment variable `PYTHONPATH` is exported correctly

### `loggers_blacklist`
[Array] String where each string is logger ID. Whenever request using these loggers are received, they are ignored without notifying the user.

## Comments
Because Residue configuration is in JSON format, comments are not supported as there should be no comment in JSON file. With that said there are ways to have comments around it.

1. You can have a seperate "object" for comment e.g,

```javascript
...
    "comment", "following backup directory will be in original logging directory",
    "archived_log_directory": "%original/backups/%logger/",
    "comment", "another comment",
    "archived_log_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.log",
    "comment", "another comment",
    "archived_log_compressed_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.tar.gz",
    "known_clients": [
...
```

Please note, this is not preferred way as parsing may get slower with increasing comments.

2. You can have comment using `//` or `/* */` in the file and then before you pass it on to residue, run it through jsMin. e.g, for file `test.json`

```javascript
...
    // following backup directory will be in original logging directory
    "archived_log_directory": "%original/backups/%logger/",
    // another comment
    "archived_log_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.log",
    // another comment
    "archived_log_compressed_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.tar.gz",
    "known_clients": [
...
```

```
cat test.json | jsmin > test-nocomments.json && residue test-nocomments.json
```

**This is preferred way** as it will only pass on what is really needed.

## Sample
Please refer to [sample configuration file](/samples/residue.conf.json) for understanding it better.
